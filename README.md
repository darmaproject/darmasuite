# Darma Cash Project: Secure, Private DAG Blockchain with Smart Contracts
## ABOUT DARMA CASH PROJECT V1
Darma Cash (DMCH) launched in 2019, aims to be the cutting-edge new generation anonymous blockchain based on Monero (XMR). DMCH adopts the Block DAG block ledger with PPoS and integrates private addresses, concealed financial data, masked identities, traceless IP, private smart contracts and DeFi/DEX on the privacy framework of Monero. The goal of the DMCH project is to establish a decentralized distributed privacy community ecosystem on top of the DMCH blockchain. DMCH introduces the core concept of Pool PoS (PPoS), which means decentralized PoS without node restrictions aiming to realize a high-speed private global SDWAN through the expansion of PPoS nodes. DMCH aims to be not only a crypto currency but also a decentralized private Internet.

We upgraded the project chain technology from v1 to v2 in June 2020. The reason for this upgrade is that the old chain cannot support new functions at the technical level. In order to make the project to have a wider application space, we have completed a comprehensive upgrade of the technology.

The v2 mainnet and the v1 mainnet are two separate public chains, so the tokens of the two chains are different and not interoperable.

Except for 3% pre-mining which is originally designed for project team's reward, all the tokens of the old v1 mainnet are mined through mining. The genesis block of the new v2 mainnet contains all the tokens in circulation of the old v1 mainnet (the block reward of the old v1 mainnet is 0 now).

The total amount of tokens on the new mainnet and the old mainnet is same, and the exchange is carried out according to the ratio of 1:1.

There is a "exchange" time window for v1 mainnet token and v2 mainnet token. After the exchange work is completed, no other exchange channels will be provided. Tokens that have not been exchanged in time (including those users who lost their seeds causing the token "disappear") will be donated to the community together with 3% pre-mine of the old v1 mainnet. The donation is planed to support the ecological development of the project.
